The success stories of Hive, an AI solutions provider, are highlighted in the text. Hive recently raised $85 million in a funding round, bringing its total business funding to $121 million. The funding increased the company's valuation to $2 billion. Hive has experienced significant growth, with a 300% increase in the past year. The company has attracted famous clients such as Reddit, Chatroulette, Omegle, Walmart, Visa, and Tango.

Hive was founded in 2017 by Kevin Guo, who previously had a Q&A platform called Kiwi. The company initially focused on image identification services and helping companies build AI systems. However, their current focus is on moderation, including images, text, and streamed audio. Hive has accumulated data by crowdsourcing feedback from around 2 million users who are paid to review images and text for online abuse. This data fuels the company's APIs, which enable business customers to operate their own moderation solutions and other workflows.

The majority of Hive's language AI learning abilities currently revolve around English, Spanish, and French. However, the company plans to use a portion of the funding to increase its global coverage and support more languages. The text also mentions a new advertising approach by Hive, where ads related to what business customers have seen on the screen are shown.

Investors have shown interest in Hive due to the potential of its AI technology and its future applications. The company aims to be a leader in cloud-hosted machine learning models and believes this will be a significant component of cloud growth in the coming years.
