Based on the provided text, the challenges faced by a Hive AI company are as follows:

1. KyroSerialization Buffer overflow: The company needs to set the KyroSerialization property in the configuration file to prevent buffer overflow issues. This suggests that they may be facing challenges related to managing large amounts of data and efficiently serializing Parquet and Avro files.

2. Compatibility issues with Spark Parquet serDe: When upgrading from EMR 3.9 to 4.4, the company faced issues where Spark Parquet serDe stopped supporting Hive. This resulted in the inability to fetch data from the Hive shell. The solution being pursued is replacing the incompatible JAR file with a compatible one. This indicates that the company utilizes Hive for data storage and querying, and faced compatibility challenges while integrating it with Spark.

3. Performance optimization: The company needs to optimize both queries and the Hive config file to improve performance based on their cluster configuration. The current cluster consists of 7 nodes, each having 16 cores and 128 GB memory. This suggests that the company is dealing with large-scale data processing and analysis, and needs to optimize their setup for efficient execution of queries.

Unfortunately, the text does not provide information specifically about a Hive AI company or any AI-related challenges they might face. It mainly focuses on technical challenges related to Hive and Spark usage in a general context.
