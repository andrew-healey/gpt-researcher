Vevo has partnered with AI company Hive to mine and label different visual elements within each of our music videos. Data like logos, objects and settings will be fed into a model that groups common elements together, helping us find visually similar content.
This means more exciting and thematic CTV blocks for viewers, as well as custom contextual advertising opportunities for brands.
