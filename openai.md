How does GitHub copilot work â€“ does it just plug into your existing editor? Could any company build an editor plugin on top of OpenAI?

For transactional folks who do M&A or otherwise do deals of some sort, assuming the smart folks at OpenAI and elsewhere figure out how to get generative AI to be reliable and not make stuff up, what features would you be willing to pay money for? What problems would you like it to solve? Personally Iâ€™d like something to catch and fix broken cross references for me.

    Good overall fun but hard questions that I couldnâ€™t pick up in time. The people there seem nice and the overall atmosphere was great. The people who were there are very friendly and kind. Overall good interview process but not a great experience for me personally.
