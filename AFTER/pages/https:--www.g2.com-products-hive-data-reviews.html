"Undoubtedly the best crowdfunding work on the web "
What do you like best about Hive Data?

Undoubtedly this application has many advantages, visually I like your presentation, the way your presentation is designed allows you to navigate clearly.

You can see the available tasks, the individual and general statistics, your payment information.

The initial screen presents all the necessary information, in addition there are always jobs available, much of the information and guides within the page you can get it in Spanish.

It has a lot of time in the market and is very serious people, the level of failure allowed is greater than that of other similar pages.

What do you dislike about Hive Data?

Among the points of improvement are the following aspects:

Within the payment options, only verified Paypal accounts are offered, for many countries and users it is an inconvenience, they must expand their range of payment operators for workers outside the USA.

Compared to other similar companies, they pay less for similar activities, although it makes up for it because they always have tasks available.

They must include a table online within the tasks performed, so you can see if you are doing the task well, and otherwise improve. This option includes it in the test tests but not in the tasks as such.

You only know that you are performing the task wrong when you are temporarily or permanently suspended.

It requires a good connection, sometimes you run the risk of losing tasks when the connection is not good, and are not computed to your statistics.
