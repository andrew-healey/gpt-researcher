Introduction 
We live in a world of exponentially growing data, with more data created in the last two 
years than in the rest of human history. In a digitized world, companies churn out trillions 
of bytes of data from their consumers as they go about their day – posting, sharing, and 
communicating. This presents unprecedented opportunity to derive a level of 
understanding about the customer unthinkable even a few years ago. 
 
While traditionally this data would be analyzed through data analytics (namely multiple 
forms of regression and statistical analysis), it is now widely agreed that machine learning 
algorithms can better solve certain forms of problems. However, limitations still that 
have made applying machine learning to the vast oceans of data collected and stored 
difficult and prohibitively expensive.  
 
Increasingly this captured data has taken unstructured forms, namely images and video.  
Rich media data has long been an intractable task by traditional machine learning 
approaches. In the past, utilizing this information required a person to act as a scribe 
between the visual data and the numeric data that a computer is able recognize. It is only 
then that traditional machine learning algorithms would be able to be applied. This 
solution does not provide the scale or the cost-effectiveness to keep up with the rapidly 
growing volumes of data and demand for new machine learning classifiers.  
 
With little means to process or analyze this data, petabytes of image and videos sit in 
archives and data centers neither used nor useful. From security camera footage in 
stores to media broadcasts, organizations globally are not able to realize the potential of 
their vast data stores. And with the lost ability to harness this data, comes the loss of 
millions to billions of dollars of lost revenues and wasted analysis. 
 
It is only with the extraordinary technological advances in computer vision in the past few 
years that trailblazers in the machine learning industry have begun to harness this data to 
provide valuable insights. Hive is one such trailblazer. 
 
Through our position as a full stack machine learning company, we are able to iterate and 
improve our classifiers faster than our competition to bring impactful computer vision 
solutions to your company. We partner with leaders and disrupters in their respective 
industries, giving them the ability to thrive in the business of tomorrow.

Computer vision as a solution 
Computer vision began in the 1970s with the goal of allowing machines to “see” and 
perceive as humans do. Even with all the technological advances over the past 40+ years, 
the primary goal remains unchanged. 
 
Computer vision in the most general sense allows a computer to take visual data as an 
input and convert it into numeric information. For machine learning purposes, this 
creates the necessary structure from the visual data for machine learning algorithms to 
be able to form classifiers of the visual data. 
 
After decades of research with few practical results, in recent years, rapid advances in 
technology have dramatically changed the field.  Primarily due to advancements in chip 
manufacturing led by companies such as NVIDIA, the computational power has increased 
and cost has decreased to a point where successful commercial use-cases are possible in 
conjunction with advances in machine learning techniques. New technologies such as 
Deep Learning have emerged, drastically changing the possibilities of computers in the 
seeing and perceiving space.   
 
Some of the more recognized applications of computer vision and machine learning are 
models that can describe an image utilizing free-form text or even to drive a car.  
 
Exhibit 1: Samples of computer vision uses 
 
 
However, this same technology can be applied at a smaller scale and still produce insights 
that have a significant impact on your company and change how you can compete in the 
rapidly evolving global economy. Hive already partnered with both entrenched leaders 
and innovative players across a variety of industries to employ this new technology in 
commercially sound contexts.

Sample projects & partners 
Large Media 
Company 
Hive partnered with a large media company to analyze a 
critical sporting event, providing a frame-by-frame analysis 
to allow them to optimize their coverage accordingly 
 
Yellow has used Hive’s pre-trained NSFW classifier to 
prevent inappropriate user content from circulating 
 
Melon rose to one of the top apps on the app store by 
carefully curating users and immediately removing explicit 
users via the Hive NSFW pre-trained classifier 
 
Plaza utilized Hive both to monitor for contraband items 
through its NSFW filter and to better tag items to improve 
suggested items and reduce user friction 
 
 
Hive’s advantage 
With the proliferation of computer vision tools and techniques it is now possible for a 
dedicated group of machine learning engineers to create vision classifies relatively 
quickly given a clean set of labelled data. These engineers can then provide these APIs to 
other industries as a service. These APIs have become a type of commodity crucial for 
powering applications and devices. They are the new electricity of today.  
 
Hive possesses a unique advantage in producing new models and ensuring these are 
ready to power your business forward. Our position as a full stack machine learning 
company enables us to understand both the opportunity and the challenges at each step 
of the machine learning workflow. We have products built specifically for data labelling, 
machine learning, and enterprise implementation all under one roof.  
 
Our completely in-house development model allows us to greatly increase the speed at 
which we improve our existing machine learning classifiers by shortening iteration cycles. 
Through relationships with our partners, we are able acquire the raw data behind new 
people, places, and ideas. We are then able to utilize our internal data labelling platform 
to immediately structure this data for machine learning use. 
 
We have found great success in utilizing our improved product design model in the 
computer vision space. There, we have developed state-of-the-art models in violence, 
logo, biometric, celebrity recognition. See the below case studies for additional details.

Case study 1 – Celebrity 
Celebrity face-recognition models aim to identify celebrities and other public persons in 
images and videos. While this goal has been in place for the past ten years, there have 
been major strides recently that have increased the accuracy of these classifiers. 
 
Hive has implemented its own celebrity recognition system using a combination of facial 
recognition technology and deep neural networks. Our classifier identifies each 
recognized celebrity in the test image and gives a confidence score. See Exhibit 2 below 
for a sample of our celebrity model. 
 
Exhibit 2: Sample of Hive’s celebrity model 
 
 
 
Comparison with Amazon Rekognition 
To better understand the capabilities of our celebrity classifier, we pitted our classifier 
against Amazon’s facial recognition technology. The test consisted a random set of 500 
celebrity and politician photos – to ensure that we covered a wide range of ages. The test 
sets were selected to be difficult where all the images would be new to the classifier to 
ensure fair analysis. 
 
Exhibit 3 highlights an example between the two classifiers on celebrities, while Exhibit 4 
shows a comparison between an image of politicians

Both Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 illustrate our classifier’s increased precision and our ability to 
detect more difficult faces. 
 
In Exhibit 3, both models correctly recognize Kayne West with approximately the same 
level of confidence, however the Amazon Facial Classifier fails to recognize his wife Kim 
Kardashian. Both faces are difficult for most facial recognition detection classifiers due to 
the angled shots. We have tuned our models to specifically recognize faces from the all 
angles, including difficult side shots. 
 
In Exhibit 4, both models correctly recognize Chuck Schumer, however Hive’s model 
correctly labels Bernie Sanders without the false positive on Ernesto Pernia. Again, the 
image of Bernie Sanders is difficult due to the low resolution and blurriness of the face. 
Our model has also been tuned against lower quality images to better serve live video 
chatting platforms, which frequently require classification of low resolution images. 
 
Overall, our classifier was able to outperform Amazon across the test set of 500 
celebrities and politicians at similar recall levels. Exhibit 5 below highlights the precision 
of Hive on this test set. 
 
Exhibit 5: Comparison of results Hive AI vs. Amazon Rekognition 
 
Hive Amazon 
Precision 90.9% 86.4% 
Recall 
70.6% 70.1% 
 
 
As can be seen by the example and the test results, in a short amount of time we have 
managed to achieve a comparable, if not higher, performance compared to one of the 
largest established players in the industry. This is due to highly tuned deep learning

architectures and a range of engineering challenges we’ve overcome, which effectively 
filter noise out of large amounts of data and quickly index millions of images. As we 
continue to develop and improve these models with an ensemble of advanced 
algorithms, we expect our performance to continue to improve.  
 
Already, we have built one of the largest databases of celebrities for machine learning 
classification in the world using our distributed data labelling platform. We believe that it 
is this focused approach on the practical applications of computer vision that gives us the 
necessary edge to propel our future success. 
 
Business case for celebrity modeling – media 
Celebrity tagging is an especially useful insight for traditional media and advertising 
campaigns. Currently, media companies cannot confirm exactly what is airing at any 
given point in time. This creates difficulties in valuing the effectiveness of a given 
advertising campaign or sponsorship.  
 
Using its celebrity classifier, Hive has created an interface that specifically tackles this 
problem in Hive Media. Hive media allows our partners to identify which celebrity is on 
the screen at any given moment on standard network shows. See Exhibit 6 for a 
screenshot of the Hive Media product in action. 
 
Exhibit 6: Hive Media production example of celebrity tagging – Donald Trump

By juxtaposing this data with viewership numbers, media companies will be able to derive 
precise, data-backed insights on impact of celebrity sponsorship. Companies will also be 
able to understand public perception of celebrities in a quantifiable manner that was 
impossible prior to the application of computer vision. 
Case study 2 – Biometrics 
Biometric machine learning models aim to provide a range of user information including 
gender, ethnicity, and age. Here at Hive, we have implemented the ability to recognize all 
three of these biometric categories using advanced facial detection algorithms. 
 
Of all the biometric machine learning classifiers, age classification remains one the most 
popular and most difficult problems to solve. Many companies both large and small have 
been creating age classifiers, such as Microsoft’s viral HowOldRobot. We have created 
our own version of this age classifier that captures the user’s age within 5 years. See 
Exhibit 7 for a sample of this classifier at work. 
 
Exhibit 7: Sample of Hive’s age classifier 
 
 
 
In addition to age, Hive has created classifiers to distinguish user gender and ethnicity 
through visual data. Our classifier can distinguish between persons of African, Arabic, 
Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Indian backgrounds. See Exhibit 8 for samples of real 
images that have gone through our gender classifier and Exhibit 9 for an example of the 
ethnicity classifier.

Exhibit 8: Sample of Hive’s gender classifier 
 
 
Exhibit 9: Sample of Hive’s ethnicity classifier 
 
 
We have reached >95% accuracy on our gender classifiers and >90% accuracy on our 
ethnicity classifiers. These results are comparable with similar classifiers offered by our 
major competitors. See Exhibit 10 for more details on the accuracy of our ethnicity 
classifier.

To date, our recognition models have trained on millions of images have and through our 
relationship with some of our customers, we continue to ingest thousands of images 
every day. This allows us a steady flow of data to better train our classifiers and in turn 
improve our customer’s experience. 
 
Business case for biometric modeling – Melon 
Companies can utilize this information to better understand their users and derive 
valuable insights on their business. We partnered with Melon for them to derive those 
insights. 
 
We have implemented our biometric classifier technology into Melon’s video app to 
allow them to better enforce their age-requirement and to give them additional data on 
the hundreds of thousands of video calls they have on their platform every day. They 
then use this data to identify which types of calls last longer, whether users are being 
truthful about their profiles, and optimize their matching algorithm to improve user 
experience. Working with Melon, we fine-tuned our biometric classifiers for the lower-

quality videos common on chat apps. From this partnership, we became one of the 
leading machine learning companies at extracting biometric information from low-quality 
images. 
Case study 3 – Violence 
Violence models and their counterpart in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) models are primarily 
used as screening methods for marketplaces and other platforms to prevent contraband 
from entering these platforms. However, these violence models can also be used to in 
traditional media to better understand the effect of violent scenes on viewership 
numbers and ratings. 
 
Hive has developed a violence model that can detect various classes of violence including 
guns, blood, explosions and fights. This classifier is again based on deep neural network 
technology. Our training set primarily leverages images of contraband found on 
marketplace apps and various scenes from movies. See Exhibit 11 below for an example 
output from our violence model. 
 
Exhibit 11: Sample of Hive’s violence classifier 
 
 
Business case for violence – protecting communities 
Violence machine learning models are critical to creating safe communities and 
increasing the overall user experience. You don’t need to go back far to find examples of 
graphic events occurring in safe communities. Instances of such events occurring on 
Facebook Live have become more common and more extreme. Traditional means of 
reporting simply cannot keep up with the pace and scale at which videos are uploaded. 
 
Hive has already implemented protections for many of our community based partners 
including Plaza (a new take on marketplaces), Melon (a live video chatting app), and 
Chatous (a live chat app). By running the user created images and video streams through

our pre-trained violence model, our partners can regulate exactly who and what are 
allowed take part in these communities. 
 
Conclusion 
As we move away from text towards an increasingly image and video dominated world, 
new methodologies are necessary to derive insights from this new treasure trove of 
consumer data. One such technique that can handles this increased throughput is the 
combination of computer vision and machine learning. 
 
While advances technology and chip-design have allow many players to enter this space, 
very few possess the correct mix of understanding and practicality that allow for the 
creation of commercially viable products necessary to prepare your company for the 
challenges of the next 20 years. Hive is one company that does. 
 
We have demonstrated that our position as a full-stack machine learning company gives 
us a unique advantage in developing innovative and cost-efficient classifiers. Our 
performance rivals that the largest players, but we possess a sense of focus that gives us 
the edge. 
 
To prepare your company for the increasingly competitive and rapidly evolving economic 
climate, incorporation of machine learning into your companies needs to be a top 
priority. Hive is here to help you accelerate this AI-led transformation and either become 
or remain an industry leader for the coming decades.
