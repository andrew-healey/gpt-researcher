Our Investors
Our Story
Hive is the leading provider of cloud-based AI solutions for understanding content, trusted by the world's largest, fastest-growing, and most innovative organizations. We empower developers with a portfolio of best-in-class, pre-trained AI models, serving billions of customer API requests every month. We also offer turnkey software products powered by proprietary AI models and datasets, enabling breakthrough applications for critical business needs. Collectively, our technology is transforming approaches to content moderation, copyright infringement, sponsorship measurement, context-based ad targeting, and more.
Communicate with candor
We celebrate direct and honest communication. As a team, we believe professional development is an output of both genuine praise and an openness to challenge with direct feedback. With our customers, this candor means that we would rather say “we can't” and preserve trust, than overpromise and tarnish relationships.
Responsible growth
We are building a business for long-term success, rooted in a portfolio of products with viable business models. We are a high growth company, but don’t pursue near-term revenue or undisciplined investments that are misaligned with our long-term plans.
Product is paramount
We are builders, with a business defined by trailblazing products that solve difficult problems. Sales and marketing are critical enablers of our growth, but unmatched product quality will always be the foundation of our success.
Set the pace
Our steadfast commitment to our mission pushes us to work harder, faster, and smarter than our peers, with an urgency that propels us forward even when the competition is already behind us.
Solve for scale
If it isn't scalable, it isn't worth doing. We focus on building AI solutions relevant to large sets of customers, and resist developing products which rely on the customization and enablement services that have limited the scalability of other AI companies.
