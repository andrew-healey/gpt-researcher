SAN FRANCISCO, CA, March 10, 2020 — Hive has been named to Fast Company’s prestigious annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2020.

The list honors the businesses making the most profound impact on both industry and culture, showcasing a variety of ways to thrive in today’s fast-changing world. This year’s MIC list features 434 businesses from 39 countries.

“It’s an honor to be featured in Fast Company’s list of the Most Innovative Companies for 2020,” said Kevin Guo, Co-Founder and CEO of Hive. “This recognition follows a year of step-change growth in Hive’s business and team, and symbolizes our progress in powering practical AI solutions for enterprise customers across industries.”

Hive is a full-stack AI company specialized in computer vision and deep learning, serving clients across industries with data labeling, model licensing, and subscription data products. During 2019, Hive grew to more than 100 clients, including 10 companies with market capitalizations exceeding $100 billion.

At the core of Hive’s business, the company operates the world’s largest distributed workforce of humans labeling data – now boasting nearly 2 million registered contributors globally. Hive’s workforce hand-labeled more than 1.3 billion pieces of training data in 2019, inputs to a consensus-driven workflow that powers deep learning models with unparalleled accuracy compared to similar offerings from the largest public cloud providers.

The company’s core models serve use cases including automated content moderation, logo and object detection, optical character recognition, voice transcription, and context classification. Across its models, Hive processed nearly 20 billion API calls in 2019.

The company also operates Mensio, a media analytics platform developed in partnership with Bain & Company that integrates Hive’s proprietary TV content metadata on commercial airings and camera-visible sponsorship placements with third-party viewership and outcome datasets. Mensio is currently in use by leading TV network owners, brands, and agencies for competitive intelligence, media planning, and optimization.

Fast Company’s editors and writers sought out the most groundbreaking businesses on the planet and across myriad industries. They also judged nominations received through their application process.
The World’s Most Innovative Companies is Fast Company’s signature franchise and one of its most highly anticipated editorial efforts of the year. It provides both a snapshot and a road map for the future of innovation across the most dynamic sectors of the economy.

“At a time of increasing global volatility, this year’s list showcases the resilience and optimism of businesses across the world. These companies are applying creativity to solve challenges within their industries and far beyond,” said Fast Company senior editor Amy Farley, who oversaw the issue with deputy editor David Lidsky.

Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies issue (March/April 2020) is now available online at fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2020, as well as in app form via iTunes and on newsstands beginning March 17, 2020. The hashtag is #FCMostInnovative.
