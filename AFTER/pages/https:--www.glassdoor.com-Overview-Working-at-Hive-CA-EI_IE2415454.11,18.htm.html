Technical Account Manager

Being a woman in tech, I only recently started advocating for myself at work about advancement opportunities. Because of this I wanted to ask this question to my male counterparts. When you have 1:1's with your direct reports and talk about career growth / aspirations what is your managers’ response typically? I’d like to gauge how my experience (negative) differs from others. For instance are you met with blockades, enthusiasm, dread, etc?

Interviewing for a security assurance analyst position with Twilio and some of the stuff I’ve been reading makes me nervous. Any Twilio people here that can speak to overall company culture and work/life balance?
