Hive AI has conducted several case studies to showcase their capabilities in different areas:

1. Celebrity Recognition:
- Hive has developed their own celebrity recognition system using facial recognition technology and deep neural networks.
- Their classifier demonstrated increased precision and ability to recognize difficult faces compared to Amazon's facial recognition technology.
- The test involved a random set of 500 celebrity and politician photos, including difficult angles and varied ages.
- Hive's model achieved a precision rate of 90.9% and a recall rate of 70.6%.
- Specific examples of recognized celebrities by Hive's model include Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.

2. Biometrics:
- Hive has implemented biometric machine learning models that can recognize gender, ethnicity, and age.
- Their biometric classifiers achieved over 95% accuracy in gender classification and over 90% accuracy in ethnicity classification.
- They have developed an age classification model that captures a user's age within 5 years.
- Ethnicity classifier can distinguish between persons of African, Arabic, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Indian backgrounds.

Specific case studies conducted by Hive AI include:

3. Melon Video App:
- Hive integrated their biometric classifier technology into Melon's video app.
- This implementation allowed Melon to enforce age requirements and gather additional data on video calls, improving user experience.
- The data collected through the biometric classifier helped Melon optimize their matching algorithm.

4. Violence Models:
- Hive developed violence models based on deep neural network technology.
- These models can detect violence-related imagery such as guns, blood, explosions, and fights.
- They are primarily trained on images of contraband from marketplace apps and scenes from movies.
- The violence models are used for screening purposes in marketplaces and platforms to prevent entry of contraband.
- They can also be utilized in traditional media to understand the impact of violence on viewership numbers and ratings.

Overall, Hive AI highlights the importance of incorporating machine learning and AI into companies to navigate the image and video-dominated world, gain consumer insights, and develop commercially viable classifiers. They claim to possess the expertise and practicality necessary for the next 20 years.
