A segment-anything model in machine learning refers to an AI model called SAM (Segment Anything Model) developed by Meta. SAM is capable of segmenting objects from images and videos based on a given prompt. It is trained to generate masks for almost any existing object and has a good understanding of various types of images and videos. SAM is a general model that can adapt to more complicated objects without retraining, allowing it to segment unknown objects through prompts. It is considered the first foundation model for promptable segmentation and can segment any object from any photo or video with just one click. The model represents a significant advancement in the field of segmentation in machine learning.
