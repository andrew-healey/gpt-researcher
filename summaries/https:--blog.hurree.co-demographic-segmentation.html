It primarily focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of demographic segmentation as a specific approach to market segmentation.

Weaknesses:

- It runs the risk of alienating people who do not fit into traditional demographic categories.
- Demographic data can become outdated as lifestyles and societal norms change over time.
- Census data is not always reliable as it is subject to changes in age, income, marital status, education level, occupation, etc.
- It is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of information provided by individuals, and people may provide false information willingly.
- Demographic segmentation may not be sufficient in capturing the complexities and diversity of the target audience, such as gender fluidity and changes in family structures.
