The text does not specifically mention the application of segment-anything models in data analysis. The information provided focuses on the potential of Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) in image segmentation tasks. It describes SAM as an efficient and promptable model that can generate masks automatically, create segmentation masks using bounding boxes, and convert object detection datasets into segmentation masks. SAM is trained using over 1 billion masks on 11 million licensed and privacy-respecting images, and it has competitive zero-shot performance. Different encoders can be loaded with SAM to influence inference speed. The text explains how to use SAM to generate masks automatically and how to apply bounding boxes for focusing on specific image portions. However, beyond computer vision tasks, the application of segment-anything models in data analysis is not discussed in the text.
