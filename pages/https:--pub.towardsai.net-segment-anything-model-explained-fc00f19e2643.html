Segmentation is the ability to take an image and identify the objects, people, or anything of interest. It’s done by identifying which image pixels belong to which object, and it’s super useful for tons of applications where you need to know what’s going on, like a self-driving car on the road identifying other cars and pedestrians.
We also know that prompting is a new skill for communicating with AIs.
What about promptable segmentation?
Promptable segmentation is a new task that was just introduced with an amazing new AI model by Meta; SAM. SAM stands for Segment Anything Model and is able to segment anything following a prompt.
How cool is that?!
In one click, you can segment any object from any photo or video!It is the first foundation model for this task trained to generate masks for almost any existing object. It’s just like ChatGPT for segmenting images, a very general model pretty much trained with every type of image and video with a good understanding of every object. And similarly, it has adaptation capabilities for more complicated objects like a very specific tool or machine. This means you can help it segment unknown objects through prompts without retraining the model, which is called zero-shot transfer. “Zero-shot” as in it has never seen that in training.
