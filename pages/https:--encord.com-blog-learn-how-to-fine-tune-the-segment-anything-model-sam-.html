Conclusion
Computer vision is having its ChatGPT moment with the release of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta last week. Trained over 11 billion segmentation masks, SAM is a foundation model for predictive AI use cases rather than generative AI. While it has shown an incredible amount of flexibility in its ability to segment over wide-ranging image modalities and problem spaces,¬†it was released without ‚Äúfine-tuning‚Äù functionality.
This tutorial will outline some of the key steps to fine-tune SAM using the mask decoder, particularly describing which functions from SAM to use to pre/post process the data so that it's in a good shape for fine tuning.
Update: By popular demand - we've included a full Colab Notebook with all the code you need to fine-tune SAM. The link can be found reading on üëá
What is the Segment Anything Model (SAM)?
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a segmentation model developed by Meta AI. It is considered the first foundational model for Computer Vision. SAM was trained on a huge corpus of data containing millions of images and billions of masks, making it extremely powerful. As its name suggests, SAM is able to produce accurate segmentation masks for a wide variety of images. SAM‚Äôs design allows it to take human prompts into account, making it particularly powerful for Human In The Loop annotation. These prompts can be multi-modal: they can be points on the area to be segmented, a bounding box around the object to be segmented or a text prompt about what should be segmented.
The model is structured into 3 components: an image encoder, a prompt encoder and a mask decoder.
Source.
The image encoder generates an embedding for the image being segmented, whilst the prompt encoder generates an embedding for the prompts. The image encoder is a particularly large component in the model. This is in contrast to the lightweight mask ¬† decoder, which predicts segmentation masks based on the embeddings. Meta AI has made the weights and biases of the model trained on the Segment Anything 1 Billion Mask (SA-1B) dataset available as a model checkpoint. Learn more about how Segment Anything works in our explainer blog post here.
What is Model Fine-Tuning?
Publicly available state of the art models have a custom architecture and are typically supplied with pre-trained model weights. If these architectures were supplied without weights then the models would need to be trained from scratch by the users, who would need to use massive datasets to obtain state of the art performance.
Model fine tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model (architecture+weights) and showing it data for a particular use case. This will typically be data that the model hasn‚Äôt seen before, or that is underrepresented in its original training dataset.
The difference between fine tuning the model and starting from scratch is the starting value of the weights and biases. If we were training from scratch, these would be randomly initialised according to some strategy. In such a starting configuration, the model would ‚Äòknow nothing‚Äô of the task at hand and perform poorly. By using pre existing weights and biases as a starting point we can ‚Äòfine tune‚Äô the weights and biases so that our model works better on our custom dataset. For example: the information learnt to recognise cats (edge detection, counting paws) will be useful for recognising dogs.
Why Would I Fine-Tune a Model?
The purpose of fine tuning a model is to obtain higher performance on data which the pre-trained model has not seen before. For example, an image segmentation model trained on a broad corpus of data gathered from phone cameras will have mostly seen images from a horizontal perspective.
If we tried to use this model for satellite imagery taken from a vertical perspective, it may not perform as well. If we were trying to segment rooftops, the model may not yield the best results. The pre-training is useful because the model will have learnt how to segment objects in general, so we want to take advantage of this starting point to build a model which can accurately segment rooftops. Furthermore, it is likely that our custom dataset would not have millions of examples, so we want to fine tune instead of training the model from scratch.
Fine tuning is desirable so that we can obtain better performance on our specific use case, without having to incur the computational cost of training a model from scratch.
How to Fine-Tune Segment Anything Model [With Code]
Background & Architecture
We gave an overview of the SAM architecture in the introduction section. The image encoder has a complex architecture with many parameters. In order to fine tune the model, it makes sense for us to focus on the mask decoder which is lightweight and therefore easier, faster and more memory efficient to fine tune.
In order to fine tune SAM, we need to extract the underlying pieces of its architecture (image and prompt encoders, mask decoder). We cannot use SamPredictor.predict (link) for two reasons:
Thus, we need to examine the SamPredictor.predict function and call the appropriate functions with gradient calculation enabled on the part we want to fine tune (the mask decoder). Doing this is also a good way to learn more about how SAM works.
Creating a Custom Dataset
We need three things to fine tune our model:
I chose the stamp verification dataset (link) since it has data which SAM may not have seen in its training (i.e., stamps on documents). I can verify that it performs well, but not perfectly, on this dataset by running inference with the pre-trained weights. The ground truth masks are also extremely precise, which will allow us to calculate accurate losses. Finally, this dataset contains bounding boxes around the segmentation masks, which we can use as prompts to SAM. An example image is shown below. These bounding boxes align well with the workflow that a human annotator would go through when looking to generate segmentations.
Input Data Preprocessing
We need to preprocess the scans from numpy arrays to pytorch tensors. To do this, we can follow what happens inside SamPredictor.set_image (link) and SamPredictor.set_torch_image (link) which preprocesses the image. First, we can use utils.transform.ResizeLongestSide to resize the image, as this is the transformer used inside the predictor (link). We can then convert the image to a pytorch tensor and use the SAM preprocess method (link) to finish preprocessing.
Training Setup
We download the model checkpoint for the vit_b model and load them in:
We can set up an Adam optimizer with defaults and specify that the parameters to tune are those of the mask decoder:
At the same time, we can set up our loss function, for example Mean Squared Error
Training Loop
In the main training loop, we will be iterating through our data items, generating masks and comparing them to our ground truth masks so that we can optimise the model parameters based on the loss function.
In this example we used a GPU for training since it is much faster than using a CPU. It is important to use .to(device) on the appropriate tensors to make sure that we don‚Äôt have certain tensors on the CPU and others on the GPU.
We want to embed images by wrapping the encoder in the torch.no_grad() context manager, since otherwise we will have memory issues, along with the fact that we are not looking to fine tune the image encoder.
We can also generate the prompt embeddings within the no_grad context manager. We use our bounding box coordinates, converted to pytorch tensors.
Finally, we can generate the masks. Note that here we are in single mask generation mode (in contrast to the 3 masks that are normally output).
The final step here is to upscale the masks back to the original image size, since they are low resolution. We can use Sam.postprocess_masks to achieve this. We will also want to generate binary masks from the predicted masks so that we can compare these to our ground truths. It is important to use torch functionals in order to not break backpropagation.
Finally we can calculate the loss and run an optimisation step:
By repeating this over a number of epochs and batches we can fine tune the SAM decoder.
Saving Checkpoints and Starting a Model from it
Once we are done with training and satisfied by the performance uplift, we can save the state dict of the tuned model using:
We can then load this state dict when we want to perform inference on data that is similar to the data we used to fine tune the model.
You can find the Colab Notebook with all the code you need to fine-tune SAM here. Keep reading if you want a fully working solution out of the box!
Fine-Tuning for Downstream Applications
While SAM does not currently offer fine-tuning out of the box, we are building a custom fine tuner integrated with the Encord platform. As shown in this post, we fine tune the decoder in order to achieve this. This is available as an out of the box one click procedure in the web app, where the hyperparameters are automatically set.
Original vanilla SAM mask:
Mask generated by fine tuned version of the model:
We can see that this mask is tighter than the original mask. This was the result of fine tuning on a small subset of images from the stamp verification dataset, and then running the tuned model on a previously unseen example. With further training and more examples we could obtain even better results.
Conclusion
That's all, folks!

In machine learning, precise image annotation is crucial for training accurate and reliable models. Encord's Bitmask brush tool revolutionizes the annotation process by allowing interactive and fine-grained selection of regions of interest within images. Designed to cater to the needs of machine learning practitioners, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the ins and outs of utilizing Encord's Bitmask brush tool, empowering you to create precise and highly accurate annotations within the Encord platform. What is the bit mask brush? A bit mask brush allows you to interactively define regions or areas of interest within an image by "brushing" over them. As you paint or brush over the image, the bit mask brush assigns specific ‚Äòbits‚Äô or values to the corresponding pixels or regions you select. These bits represent the labels or categories associated with the selected areas.
{{gray_callout_start}} Accessing brush tool: Click on üñåÔ∏è or press ‚Äòf‚Äô {{gray_callout_end}}
For example, if you are labeling outlines of blood vessels in an image, you can use a bit of mask brush to brush over the pixels corresponding to the vessel‚Äôs boundaries. The bit mask brush would assign a specific value or bit pattern to those pixels, indicating that they belong to the vessel class or category.
Similarly, if you are labeling topologically separate regions belonging to the same frame classification, you can use a bitmask brush to assign different bit patterns or values to the regions you select. This allows you to differentiate between regions or segments within the same frame category.
Using the Bitmask Brush The Bitmask brush is a powerful tool for creating annotations or labels by selecting specific regions within an image, providing flexibility and control over the labeling process. Let‚Äôs explore its key functionalities:
Selection and Size Adjustment When the Bitmask annotation type is selected, the brush tool is automatically chosen by default. You can access it by clicking the brush icon or pressing the 'f' key, and you are able to adjust the brush size using a convenient slider. This enables you to tailor the brush size to the level of detail needed for your annotations.
Annotation Creation Once you have adjusted the brush size, you can begin annotating your image by selecting the desired areas. As you brush over the regions, the Bitmask brush assigns specific bit patterns or values to the corresponding pixels, indicating their association with the selected labels or categories.
Apply Label Once your annotation is complete, you can apply the label by clicking the "Apply label" button or pressing the Enter key, finalizing the annotation and incorporating it into the labeling or annotation process.
{{gray_callout_start}} üí°To use the bitmap masks, the ontology should contain the Bitmask annotation type. {{gray_callout_end}}
Eraser The Eraser tool provides the ability to erase parts or the entirety of your bitmask selection. This can be useful if you need to refine or modify your annotations before applying the final label. You can access the Eraser tool by clicking the eraser icon or pressing the 'h' key on your keyboard while the popup window is open.
{{gray_callout_start}} Accessing eraser tool: Click on eraser icon or press ‚Äòh‚Äô {{gray_callout_end}}
Threshold Brush The Threshold brush, specific to DICOM images, offers additional functionality by enabling you to set an intensity value threshold for your labels. The preview toggle allows you to visualize which parts of the image correspond to your set threshold, helping you determine the areas that will be labeled when covered by the Threshold brush. To access the Threshold brush, click the corresponding icon or press the 'g' key while the popup window is open. Adjust the brush size and the range of intensity values using the sliders in the popup.
{{gray_callout_start}} Accessing threshold tool: Click on the corresponding icon or press ‚Äòg‚Äô {{gray_callout_end}}

In the current AI boom, one thing is certain: data is king.
Data is at the heart of the production and development of new models; and yet, the processing and structuring required to get data to a form that is consumable by modern AI are often overlooked.
One of the most primordial elements of intelligence that can be leveraged to facilitate this is search. Search is crucial to understanding data: the more ways to search and group data, the more insights you can extract. The greater the insights, the more structured the data becomes.
Historically, search capabilities have been limited to uni-modal approaches: models used for images or videos in vision use cases have been distinct from those used for textual data in natural language processing. With GPT-4‚Äôs ability to process both images and text, we are only now starting to see the potential impacts of performant multi-modal models that span various forms of data.
Embracing the future of multi-modal data, we propose the Search Anything Model. The unified framework combines natural language, visual property, similarity, and metadata search together in a single package. Leveraging computer vision processing, multi-modal embeddings, LLMs, and traditional search characteristics, Search Anything allows for multiple forms of structured data querying using natural language.
If you want to find all bright images with multiple cats that look similar to a particular reference image, Search Anything will match over multiple index types to retrieve data of the requisite form and conditions.

What is Natural Language Search? Natural Language Search (NLS) uses human-like language to query and retrieve information from databases, datasets, or documents. Unlike traditional keyword-based searches, NLS algorithms employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the context, semantics, and intent behind user queries.
By interpreting the query‚Äôs meaning, NLS systems provide more accurate and relevant search results, mimicking how humans communicate. The computer vision domain requires a similar general understanding of data content without requiring metadata for visuals.

If you feed an AI model with junk, it‚Äôs bound to return the favor. The quality of the data being consumed by an AI algorithm has a direct correlation with its success when it comes to generalizing to new instances; this is the reason data professionals spend 80% of their time during model development, ensuring the data is appropriately prepared, and is representative of the real world. Data labeling is an essential task in supervised learning, as it enables AI algorithms to create accurate input-to-output mappings and build a comprehensive understanding of their environment. Data labeling can consume up to 80% of data preparation time, and at least 25% of an entire ML project is spent labeling. Therefore, efficient data labeling strategies are critical for improving the speed and quality of machine learning model development. {{gray_callout_start}} üí°Read the blog to learn how to automate your data labeling process. {{gray_callout_end}} Manual data labeling can be a challenging and error-prone process, as it relies on human judgment and subjective interpretation. Labelers may have different levels of expertise, leading to consistency in the labeling process and reduced accuracy. Moreover, manual data labeling can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for large datasets. This can hinder the scalability and efficiency of AI model development. Integrating automated data labeling into your machine learning projects can be an effective strategy for mitigating the challenges of manual data labeling. By leveraging AI technology to perform data labeling tasks, businesses can reduce the risk of human error, increase the speed and efficiency of model development, and minimize costs associated with manual labeling.¬† Additionally, automated data labeling can help improve the accuracy and consistency of labeled data, resulting in more reliable and robust AI models. Let's take a closer look at automated data labeling, including its workings, advantages, and how Encord can assist you in automating your data labeling process. {{try_encord_CTA_annotate_visual}} Using Annotation Tools for Automated Data Labeling Automated data labeling is using software tools and algorithms to automatically annotate or tag data with labels or tags that help identify and classify the data.

It offers a user-friendly interface, supports various annotation types, and includes features for collaboration, user management, validation, and verification. CVAT is widely used in industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and healthcare. Benefits of Automated Data Labeling with AI Annotation Tools The most straightforward way to label data is to implement it manually, where a human user is presented with raw unlabeled data and applies a set of rules to label it. However, this approach has certain drawbacks such as being time-consuming and costly and having a higher probability of natural human error. An alternative approach is to use AI annotation tools to automate the labeling process, which can help address the issues associated with manual labeling by: Increasing accuracy and efficiency: ¬†Speed is just as important as being accurate. Yes, an automatic AI annotation tool can process large amounts of images much faster than a human can, but what makes it so effective is its ability to remain accurate, which ensures labels are precise and reliable.
Improving productivity and workflow: It‚Äôs normal for humans to make mistakes ‚Äì especially when they are performing the same task for 8 or more hours straight. When you use an AI-assisted labeling tool, the workload is significantly reduced, which means annotating teams can put more focus on ensuring things are labeled correctly the first time around.
Reduction in labeling costs and resources: Deciding to manually annotate data means paying someone or a group of people to carry out the task; this means each hour that goes by has a cost, which can quickly become extremely high. An AI-assisted labeling tool may take off some of that load by allowing a human annotation team can manually label a percentage of the data and then have an AI tool do the rest.¬† How to Automate Data Labeling with Encord
A step-by-step guide to automating data labeling with Encord: Micro models Micro-models are models that are designed to be overtrained for a specific task or piece of data, making them effective in automating one aspect of data annotation workflow. They are not meant to be good at solving general problems and are typically used for a specific purpose. {{gray_callout_start}} üí°Read the blog to find out more about micro-models.¬†{{gray_callout_end}} The main difference between a traditional model and a micro-model is not in their architecture or parameters but in their application domain, the data science practices used to create them, and their ultimate end-use. Step 1: Step 2: Auto-segmentation Auto-segmentation is a technique that involves using algorithms or annotation tools to automatically segment an image or video into different regions or objects of interest. This technique is used in various industries, including medical imaging, object detection, and scene segmentation. For example, in medical imaging, auto-segmentation can be used to identify and segment different anatomical structures in images, such as tumors, organs, and blood vessels. This can help medical professionals to make more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans Auto-segmentation can potentially speed up the image analysis process and reduce the likelihood of human error. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of auto-segmentation algorithms depends on the input data quality and the segmentation task's complexity. In some cases, manual review and correction may still be necessary to ensure the accuracy of the results. {{gray_callout_start}} üí°Read the explainer blog on Segment Anything Model to understand how foundation models are used for auto-segmentation. {{gray_callout_end}} Interpolation Interpolation is typically used to fill in missing values or smooth the noise in a dataset.
